# Ingenico Connect Python SDK

## Introduction

The Python SDK helps you to communicate with the [Ingenico Connect](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/) Server API. Its primary features are:

* convenient Python library for the API calls and responses
    * marshalls Python request objects to HTTP requests
    * unmarshalls HTTP responses to Python response objects or Python exceptions
* handling of all the details concerning authentication
* handling of required meta data

Its use is demonstrated by an example for each possible call. The examples execute a call using the provided API keys. 

See the [Ingenico Connect Developer Hub](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/server/python/) for more information on how to use the SDK.

## Structure of this repository

This repository consists out of four main components:

1. The source code of the SDK itself: `/ingenico/connect/sdk/` 
2. The source code of the SDK unit tests: `/tests/unit/`
3. The source code of the SDK integration tests: `/tests/integration/`
4. Usage examples: `/examples/`

Note that the source code of the unit tests and integration tests and the examples can only be found on GitHub.

## Requirements

Python 3.5 or higher is required. In addition, the following packages are required:

* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) 2.25.0 or higher
* [requests-toolbelt](https://toolbelt.readthedocs.io/) 0.8.0 or higher

These packages will be installed automatically if the SDK is installed manually or using pip following the below instructions.

## Installation

To install the SDK using pip, execute the following command:

    pip install connect-sdk-python3

Alternatively, you can install the SDK from a source distribution file:

1. Download the latest version of the Python SDK from GitHub. Choose the `connect-sdk-python3-x.y.z.zip` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Ingenico-ePayments/connect-sdk-python3/releases) page, where `x.y.z` is the version number.
2. Execute the following command in the folder where the SDK was downloaded to:
    
    ```
    pip install connect-sdk-python3-x.y.z.zip
    ```

## Uninstalling

After the Python SDK has been installed, it can be uninstalled using the following command:

    pip uninstall connect-sdk-python3

The required packages can be uninstalled in the same way.

## Running tests 

There are two types of tests: unit tests and integration tests. The unit tests will work out-of-the-box; for the integration tests some configuration is required.
First, some environment variables need to be set:
* `connect.api.apiKeyId` for the API key id to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.
* `connect.api.secretApiKey` for the secret API key to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.
* `connect.api.merchantId` for your merchant ID.

In addition, to run the proxy integration tests, the proxy URI, username and password should be set in the `tests/resources/configuration.proxy.ini` file.

In order to run the unit and integration tests, the [mock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock) backport and [mockito](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mockito) are required. These can be installed using the following command:

    pip install mock mockito

The following commands can now be executed from the `tests` directory to execute the tests:
* Unit tests:
    
    ```
    python run_unit_tests.py
    ```
* Integration tests:
    
    ```
    python run_integration_tests.py
    ```
* Both unit and integration tests:
    
    ```
    python run_all_tests.py
    ```
