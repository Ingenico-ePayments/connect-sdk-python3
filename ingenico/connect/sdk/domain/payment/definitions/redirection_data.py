        | Using the Configuration Center it is possible to create multiple variations of your MyCheckout payment pages. The redirection flow for 3-D Secure uses the MyCheckout payment pages to display the following types of pages:
        
        * Redirection page - All redirection using a POST method will load a page in the browser of the customer that performs the actual redirection. This page contains a message to the customer explaining what is happening.
        * MethodURL page - Certain Issuers will use a specific flow in case of 3-D Secure version 2 to directly collect information from the customer browser. This page contains a spinner indicating that this process is going on in.
        
        | By specifying a specific variant you can force the use of another variant than the default. This allows you to test out the effect of certain changes to your MyCheckout payment pages in a controlled manner. Please note that you need to specify the ID instead of the name of the variant.
        | Note: In case you have defined a Dynamic 3D Secure rule that takes the variant into account this will only work if you explicitly specify the ID using this property.
